h3. prototype

In a script, the 'node' is a prototype created by Node.new. The prototype stores methods
and outlet/inlet definitions. The script is run in its own private environment. This means
that it is possible to create private methods but all state information should live inside
'self' or it will be shared across objects.

h3. instance

An instance is made of an empty table with the prototype as metamethod. The instance also
contains an empty 'outlets' list with a special index method to create outlets as needed. In
order to create an outlet, the list searches the prototype's outlet definitions.
