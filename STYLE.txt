The code written here roughly conforms to http://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide#Naming. Please follow these guidelines if you want to contribute both in C++ and in Lua.

Naming conventions:

Classes             CapWords
Functions & methods firstLowerCapWords()
Constants           CAPS_WITH_UNDER
Instance Variables	lower_with_under_
Variables	& params  lower_with_under	

As an addition to these guidelines, please write tests.

== additions

- Only accessors/finders that return true or false on success should start with "get".
- "*" and "&" (C++ pointers and references) should be glued to the variable: const char *str.
