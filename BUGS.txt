* Why do fast print messages lock the editor ?
* Qt crash with retina display (ScaleFactor)
* Why does the editor take 80% CPU doing nothing ??

FIX PENDING LINKS BUGS
======================

The problem is not external pending links (we should fix the initial "connect" value
thing, though) it's the internal ones. To fix, we simply need to "NOT CREATE"
pending links and simply store a list of links to make in the process and read
this list whenever a node comes online or is removed.
1. process --> sync            ---> Morph
   process <-- patch           <--- Morph

2. process --> notify nodes    ---> Morph
   process <-- pending links*  <--- Morph

   * All possible links from and to declared nodes.

3. process --> node removed    ---> Morph + pending links


4. Morph   --> pending links list --> GUI

5. GUI  --> Display/remove pending links

TODO:
1. Remove links in process sync
2. Keep links definition in Morph
3. Keep list of active nodes in Morph
4. Send msg to create links between active nodes when node creation is notified by process
5. Process notify link creation
6. Update active/disactive node/links in Morph
